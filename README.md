# Smart Cart: CS 1050 Project

## Description

Smart Cart is a practical, simple, and effective JavaFX application designed to manage shopping lists efficiently. Developed as part of the Computer Science II course under Prof. Joshua Gyllinsky, the application allows users to plan and organize their shopping trips by creating, modifying, and saving multiple shopping lists. The application supports functionalities for managing past and planned shopping trips, as well as dynamically updating lists based on user interaction.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays the application logo and serves as the landing page.
- **Saved Trips**: Users can view and manage a list of saved shopping trips. They can add items from a tree view to their current shopping list or delete them.
- **Past Trips**: This feature allows users to review their past shopping trips categorized by date. Users can add items from past trips to their current list.
- **My List**: Users can create a new shopping list by adding new items or selecting items from past or saved trips. They can also save their current list for future reference or mark it as completed, which adds it to the Past Trips.

- **Navigating the application**: Use the tabbed interface to switch between Home, Saved Trips, Past Trips, and My List views.
- **Adding items**: Click on the "Add" button in the Saved Trips or Past Trips tabs to add selected items to My List.
- **Saving lists**: In the My List tab, after adding your items, click "Save" to save the list or "Done" to mark it as completed and add it to Past Trips.
